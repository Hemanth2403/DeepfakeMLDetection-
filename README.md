# DeepfakeMLDetection-
We show that the model proposed in current state of the art in video manipulation (FaceForensics++) does not generalize to real-life videos randomly collected from Youtube. We show the need for the detector to be constantly updated with real-world data, and propose an initial solution in hopes of solving deepfake.
